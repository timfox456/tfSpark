Tensorflow and Spark: Better Together

## Introduction

Tensorflow and Spark: two powrerful tools.

Tensorflow and Spark have a lot in common. Both are designed to be distributed engines for processing data.

The open-source tensorflow is awesome for what it does.  On Google Infrastrucutre, there is the excellent
Cloud ML Engine, which allows parallel training or deployment of tensorflow models.  However, On-Premesis
or non-Google infrastructure are not able to use Cloud ML Engine as it is not open-source.
